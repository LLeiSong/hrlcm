This is a repo for land cover classification using ensemble labels and high resolution Planet NICFI basemap in Tanzania.

## Introduction

## Acknowledgement
Because we have to make a lot of modification, it is hard to fork and change the repo directly. 
So we hard copy the scripts and adapt them. Full credit should be given to the original authors.
All the code within scripts are adapted from:
- [agroimpacts/pytorch_planet](https://github.com/agroimpacts/pytorch_planet), and
- [yassouali/pytorch_segmentation](https://github.com/yassouali/pytorch_segmentation)
